# multiple assignments allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code

# name = 'Ali'
# age = 21
# attractive = True

name, age, attractive = "Ali", 21, True

print(name)
print(age)
print(attractive)

# same value for all variables
# spongebob = 30
# patrick = 30
# sandy = 30
# squidward = 30

spongebob = patrick = sandy = squidward = 30

print(spongebob)
print(patrick)
print(sandy)
print(squidward)
